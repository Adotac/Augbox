# Experimental Project

## Augbox

### Game Description
	A normal boxing game implemented as an Augmented Reality game. There is no storyline involved in the story as the project’s main goal is for experimentation only. 
	
	Augbox will be played in an instanced boxing ring 3D environment. It’s primarily a first-person game with innovative AR and VR approaches that will make the player immerse in the game. 

### Design Goals
The game project aims to achieve these following goals:
  1. Make a cross-platform boxing game where it can be played as an AR, VR, and normally on PC. 
      - AR mode - players will be expected to play with AR devices, just like Hololens.
      - VR mode - players will be expected to play with VR devices, such as Oculus and Quest devices.
      - PC mode - when players don’t have the aforementioned devices mentioned above, they are expected to play with only a webcam at hand. Where it will use an AI for computer vision and hand tracking                        purposes and control the actions in the game just like how an AR/VR player would do.
  2. As a cross-platform game, multiplayer is an important goal to accomplish. As a boxing game, it requires two players for its essence as a one-on-one sport, showcasing the skills of each boxer in direct       competition. The two-player format fosters a competitive atmosphere, making boxing an exciting and engaging sport for both players.

### Core Gameplay
	The players can only control the character’s gloves and camera only in a 3D Virtual Area. It will follow basic Boxing mechanics where two opponents engage in a controlled and regulated contest of who will be the last standing win. The primary objective is to land punches on the opponent while avoiding getting hit in return or just blocking. The player must strategically deliver punches with their fists to score points and potentially achieve a knockout victory.
